            Guernica is a mural-sized oil painting on canvas by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso completed in June 1937,[2] at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. The painting, now in the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid, was done with a palette of gray, black, and white, and is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history.

            Pablo Ruiz Picasso ( 25 October 1881 â€“ 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[3][4] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian airforces during the Spanish Civil War.

                Standing at 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) wide, the large mural shows the suffering of people and animals wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.

                The painting was created in response to the bombing of Guernica, a Basque Country town in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany and Italian warplanes at the request of the Spanish Nationalists. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.[4] The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the Spanish Civil War.

                The scene is within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman who holds a dead child in her arms. The center of the painting is occupied by a horse falling in agony, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. There is a large gaping wound in the horse's side.

Under the horse is a dead, dismembered, soldier. The hand of his severed right arm still grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The palm of the soldier's open left hand contains a stigmata, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the stigmata of Christ. A bare light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head.
