                Composition with Red Blue and Yellow is a 1930 painting by Piet Mondrian. A well-known work of abstraction, Mondrian contributes to the abstract visual language in a large way despite using a relatively small canvas. Thick, black brushwork defines the borders of the different geometric figures. Comparably, the black brushwork on the canvas is very minimal but it is masterfully applied to become one of the defining features of the work.

                Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan, after 1906 Piet Mondrian ( 7 March 1872 – 1 February 1944), was a Dutch painter and theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.[2][3] He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements.

                    Composition with Red Blue and Yellow is a product of the Dutch De Stijl movement, which translates to “The Style.”[1] The De Stijl foundation can be viewed as an overlapping of individual theoretical and artistic pursuits. Mondrian is widely seen as the prominent artist for the movement and is thus held responsible for bringing popularity to the rather obscure style.[2] Born in the Netherlands in 1872, Mondrian is cited as always having an interest in art.

                    It was in Paris that he was introduced to Cubism, a major influence to his work. He is quoted as having said “of all the abstraction artists, I felt only the Cubists had found the right path.” .[2] He still found this style too naturalistic however, and began to dive even deeper into abstraction. A short visit back to the Netherlands led to an extended stay for five years due to the outbreak of World War 1 (1914).[2] Although an unexpected turn of events, Mondrian made many important connections during this time that led to establishment of De Stijl. An encounter with fellow Dutch artist Bart van der Leck provided ground for Mondrian to exchange ideas. From van der Leck he received the concept of painting flat areas of pure color; a solution to Mondrian’s problem of coloring - he was then using color in what he considered an Impressionist way, which was too restless and emotional. In return, van der Leck adopted Mondrian’s concept of crossed vertical and horizontal lines as a basis for composition.

                    Examining Composition with Red Blue and Yellow, Mondrian’s De Stijl practices are in full effect. The contrasting horizontal and vertical lines represent to Mondrian an active relationship in which he intended to mimic the rhythm and vibrations of life that transcends symbolic knowledge. The reduced colours of red blue and yellow and accentuated thick, black lines that cross over each other are similarly rendered. His depiction of inner reality (essence of life), is believed to be found through the interplay of contrasting pictorial elements.[2] It is arguable that all elements found within Composition are contrasting and thus indicative of the inner harmony of life that lies beneath the surface. Mondrian theories do not accumulate in Composition; he did not even consider this is a success.
